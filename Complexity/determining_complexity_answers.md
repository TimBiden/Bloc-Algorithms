1. O(1).

2. O(n). It will only run through once, finding the largest number in the collection. There is no other real work do be done with it.

3. O(n). Like the example in #2, it will only run through the collection once. Even though it's a 2D array, that doesn't change how many times it will run.

4. Exponential is the closest but it doesn't quite fit that.

5. O(n). The `temp, num1, num2` items have nothing to do wth how many operations are run. It's all about `n` and `i`.

6. This is QuickSort. The Big O is exponential.
