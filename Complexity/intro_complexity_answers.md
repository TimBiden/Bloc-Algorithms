1. An algorithm that has O(1) is a drag car going down a straight line and an algorithm that has O(2n) is a paper airplane trying to fly almost straight up.

2. The best case scenario for binary search is that the item required is the center item and it only takes 1 iteration to find it. That would make it O(1).

3. The worst-case scenario for binary search is that your item is the last possible option to choose. In a binary search, that's 8 iterations, or O(log n).

4. Interestingly, the bounded case for binary search is O(log n), which is exactly the same thing as its worst-case scenario.

6. The limit of the function when `n` approaches ∞ is ∞.

7. The Big-O of an algorithm with data points of (1,2), (2,	4), (3, 8), (4, 16) is O(nlogn).
